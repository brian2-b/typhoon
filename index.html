<h1>Common Python Data Structures</h1>


<h1>Lists:</h1>
<p>Lists are ordered collections of elements.
They can contain elements of different data types.
Elements can be accessed by their index, 
starting from 0.</p>

<h1>Tuples:</h1>
<p>Tuples are similar to lists but immutable, 
meaning their elements cannot be changed once defined.
They are often used to represent fixed collections 
of items.</p>

<h1>Sets:</h1>
<p>Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
They are useful for eliminating duplicate values 
from a list and performing set operations like 
union, intersection, and difference.</p>

<h1>Dictionaries:</h1>
<p>Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
They are unordered and use keys to access values.
Keys must be unique and immutable, 
while values can be of any data type.</p>

<h1>Arrays (from the NumPy library):</h1>
<p>Arrays are homogeneous, multidimensional data 
structures provided by the NumPy library.
They are efficient for mathematical and statistical
operations on large datasets.</p>

<h1>Linked Lists (custom implementation):</h1>
<p>Linked lists are data structures consisting of 
nodes where each node contains data and a reference
to the next node.
They are useful for dynamic data storage and 
efficient insertions and deletions.</p>

<h1>Stacks and Queues (custom implementations):</h1>
<p>Stacks are data structures with a 
Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, suitable for tasks 
like managing function calls.
Queues follow a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order and
are used for tasks like managing tasks in a queue.</p>

<h1>Heaps (from the heapq module):</h1>
<p>Heaps are specialized tree-based structures that
maintain a specific order, such as a min-heap or 
max-heap.
They are often used in priority queues and sorting 
algorithms.</p>

<h1>Deques (from the collections module):</h1>
<p>Deques (Double-Ended Queues) are versatile data 
structures that allow efficient insertions and 
removals at both ends.

They combine features of both stacks and queues.</p>
